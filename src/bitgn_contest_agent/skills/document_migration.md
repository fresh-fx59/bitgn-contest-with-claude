## Step 0: Pre-fetched context

A `PREFLIGHT` user message above (auto-dispatched by the router for this task shape) contains the canonical narrowing — the matching record(s), entity canonicalization, or destination resolution. Treat it as ground truth and start from those references. Fall through to the strategy below only if preflight returned nothing usable or the question needs more than what was pre-fetched.

## Search Strategy

1. Read the workspace documentation for migration instructions BEFORE
   taking any action. Look for process docs, migration guides, or
   system-specific instructions in the docs directory.

2. The target system's requirements, format, and conventions are defined
   in workspace docs — do not assume them. Read the relevant
   documentation to understand:
   - What format the migration queue expects
   - What metadata fields are required
   - What naming conventions to follow

3. Follow the documented migration format exactly. Do not invent fields
   or structure that the documentation does not specify.

4. Verify each referenced document exists before including it in the
   migration queue. Read the document to confirm it is the correct one.

5. If the migration instructions reference a specific directory structure
   or naming convention, follow it precisely. Do not use alternative
   paths or structures.
